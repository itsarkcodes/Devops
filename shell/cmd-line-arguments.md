# Command Line Arguments

- Command line arguments are parameters that are passed to a script or program when it is executed from the command line. 

- The command line arguments are passed to the script as a series of strings, separated by spaces. The first argument is stored in the '$1' variable, the second argument is stored in '$2', and so on

Example:

- If this script were saved as ```create-and-launch-rocket```, you could execute it from the command line like this: 

```create-and-launch-rocket mars-mission```

## Best Practices
1. Design your script to be re-usable
2. Script should not require to be edited before running.
3. Use command line arguments to pass inputs
